## Getting Started

Open the project into the IDE and create a "libs" folder into the root of the
project. Add the following binaries:

- [JSON Java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)
- [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org)

The project still doesn't integrate Gradle, so you have to add the libraries to
the project structure -> libraries (in IntelliJ).

The project runs on Java 8+.
