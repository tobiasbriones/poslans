## Getting Started

You need MySQL server installed on your machine and create the database 
provided at the [database module](../../database/poslans.sql).

After that, run the application and enter your login information to connect 
to that database as shown in the login window:

**Login Window**

Then you are redirected to the client main window with access to the database.

**Main Window**

## Campuses and Careers

Edit campus and career data your university owns from the bottom buttons:

**Edit Campus**

You will assign a password for each specific campus/career but this was an 
experimental feature. When saving you are prompted to enter your password to 
verify it's you and save the changes.

You can edit careers in the same fashion.

## Register Students and Professors

You will need the following templates to manage student and professor records:

- [mu-template-student-register](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/poslans/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.6/mu-template-student-register.xlsx)
- [mu-template-student-update](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/poslans/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.6/mu-template-student-update.xlsx)
- [mu-template-student-delete](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/poslans/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.6/mu-template-student-delete.xlsx)
- [mu-template-professor-register](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/poslans/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.6/mu-template-professor-register.xlsx)
- [mu-template-professor-update](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/poslans/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.6/mu-template-professor-update.xlsx)
- [mu-template-professor-delete](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/poslans/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.6/mu-template-professor-delete.xlsx)

Then the application allows to manage that data:

The same operations are also available for professors.

## Manage Terms

Start a new term from the main window and select the campuses and careers 
from the given table to apply that term. Some careers may be semester or 
trimester so, starting a new term might only be required for some of them.

**Start a New Term**

All other users at your university will receive the performed updates.
